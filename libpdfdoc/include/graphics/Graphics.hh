	\brief		Graphics objects module
	
	The graphics objects represent visual elements that appears in the page.
	These classes provide access to their content.
	
	\section 	gfx_coord	Coordinate Systems
	
	There are a number of coordinate system defined by the PDF specifications.
	
	\subsection	user_coord	User Space
	
	All graphics items in a PDF document uses the default coordinate called
	"User Space". It is a devices independent unit. The default unit in users
	space is point, which is 1/72 inch. In other words, the coordinate (72,72)
	is corresponding to one inch right and inch up from the origin.
	
	\subsection	text_coord	Text Space
	
	The Text Space is the coordinate system for text rendering. The
	transformation from user space to text space is defined a text matrix and
	a few text states parameters. There are a number of operators to manipulate
	the text matrix.
	
	\subsection	glyph_coord	Glyph Space
	
	Typically equals to 1/1000 units of text space, except for type 3 fonts.
	
	\subsection font_unit	Font Unit
	
	This one is not defined by the PDF specification. It is the unit used in
	TrueType font and Type 1 fonts. Actually, the physical length of a font
	unit depends on the font itself. Different fonts uses different units.
