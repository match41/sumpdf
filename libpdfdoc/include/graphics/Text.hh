/**	\ingroup graphics
	The Text class represent a PDF text object. A text object in a page contains
	a group of text string with different formats. There is no limit on how
	much text can be included in a Text object. It is completely up to the
	application which generated the PDF file.
	
	A Text object can contain multiple TextLine objects. Each TextLine object
	represent a number of characters with the same format (i.e. TextState) and
	position (i.e. transformation). As mentioned above, the PDF generator
	application defines how to group TextLine in Text objects. Technically, a
	Text object contains all the stuff enclosed by a BT...ET operators in the
	content stream of a page.
	
	The order of the TextLine in a Text object will not affect their absolute
	position in the page. It will only affect the order of rendering. In
	general, lines defined first will be rendered first. In other words,
	objects rendered subsequently may be overwritten by later objects if they
	are overlapped.
