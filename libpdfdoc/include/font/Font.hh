	/**	In creating the glyph outlines, a type designer uses an imaginary square
		called the EM square. Typically, the EM square can be thought of as a
		tablet on which the characters are drawn. The square's size, i.e., the
		number of grid units on its sides, is very important for two reasons:

		-	It is the reference used to scale the outlines to a given text
			dimension. For example, a size of 12pt at 300x300 dpi corresponds
			to 12*300/72 = 50 pixels. This is the size the EM square would
			appear on the output device if it was rendered directly. In other
			words, scaling from grid units to pixels uses the formula:

			  pixel_size = point_size * resolution / 72
			  pixel_coord = grid_coord * pixel_size / EM_size

		-	The greater the EM size is, the larger resolution the designer can
			use when digitizing outlines. For example, in the extreme example
			of an EM size of 4 units, there are only 25 point positions
			available within the EM square which is clearly not enough. Typical
			TrueType fonts use an EM size of 2048 units; Type 1 PostScript
			fonts have a fixed EM size of 1000 grid units but point coordinates
			can be expressed as floating values.
