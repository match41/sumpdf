/*!	\brief	PDF stream object
	
	This class represents a PDF stream object. A stream is a number of bytes
	stored in a PDF file. It may be encoded by a number of filters.
	Unlike other PDF object classes, this class does not support operator>>()
	and operator<<(). It is because although the Stream classes represents one
	of the fundamental data types, it may depend on references to other objects
	such as its length. It cannot be fully extracted by operator>>() and it
	can't be written completely by operator<<(). The constructor and the
	Write() function will perform reading and writing from and to file.
