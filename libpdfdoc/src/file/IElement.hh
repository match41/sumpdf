	This class represents an element of a PDF file. A so-called "element" is a
	PDF object that is sufficiently self-contain and represent a logical unit
	of a PDF file. Examples of element include pages, fonts, XObjects and 
	multimedia objects. Another features of element is that they can be referred
	by each others using references, i.e. indirect objects. It allows easy
	sharing and save memory and disk space.
	
	An element may contain child elements.
